Content requirements/design.

For each project for V1, we will have students upload one main thumbnail photo,
and 3 additional installation/progress photos plus one video if they are in
the Art/Architecture/Art History tracks.

For Music/Theater track students, we will have also a thumbnail photo, plus 3 video clips,
these video clips can also just be audio, but must be in mp4 format.

Each student will make a file with their content titled FirstLast (filling in their first and last name).
