This kinetic installation presents a multi-dimensional representation 
of the how cultural and generational gap is facilitated 
by self-censoring images during communication between parents and children, 
and to trigger conversations on how critical it is to arrive at better family dynamics 
that encourage open communication. It is comprised of a machine-learning 
Convoluted Neural Network (CNN), a self-automated sculpture, 
image projection on VHS, and a corresponding hand-bound book discussing 
the violence and intimacy of first generation immigrants. 
Through these intersecting components, I delve into the emotional effects of surveillance, 
not as a public social issue but as a reaction to distrust within intimate relationships, 
as well as its effect on young adults navigating their individual maturity 
separate from their households.
